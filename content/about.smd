## What we do

At **AI Research & Technology Lab GmbH**, we enable pioneering research projects through advanced technology development. We work with research institutes and innovative companies to build **AI systems that turn data and ideas into decisions and experiments** – not just demos.

Our work ranges from **AI decision systems** that sit on top of existing dashboards and data warehouses, to **AI-powered experiment and lab platforms** that make complex studies actually runnable in practice.

**You already have dashboards, metrics, and reports; we build the AI systems that can use them to run structured what-if scenarios and support real decisions.**

## AI decision systems for real-world decisions

Many organisations already track everything: KPIs, funnels, survey results, experiment outcomes. What's missing is a **decision layer**: a system that can query this data on demand, run structured "what-if" scenarios, and surface recommendations a human can actually act on.

We design and build **AI decision systems** that:

- connect to your existing tools and data sources via well-defined APIs,
- run controlled **tool-using agents** that stay within guardrails,
- produce **traceable briefings** instead of opaque answers, and
- keep a **decision and reasoning log** so experiments and decisions can be audited or revisited later.

This makes it possible to move from "we have dashboards" to **"we have AI that helps us decide what to do next."**

## Experiment & lab platforms

A core focus of the lab is building **AI-powered experimental systems** for social science, HRI, and human-AI interaction research.

Examples include:

- **Social robot interviewers** – such as the AI "brain" for *Willi*, a social robot that interviews visitors at an innovation lab (public write-up will follow).
- **Multi-module online experiments** – where one system coordinates shopping assistants, chat-based interviewers, and survey components into a single study flow.
- **Custom lab tooling** – including precise **sensor synchronization**, logging infrastructure, and control software that ties together robots, screens, sensors, and backends.

Behind each visible system is a set of **enabling technologies**: domain models, tool APIs, simulators, and experiment logic that make studies **repeatable, adaptable, and analysable** instead of one-off prototypes.

## Expert engineering as a foundation

Under everything we build is a commitment to **expert engineering**:

- **Correctness and reliability** – tested components, careful treatment of edge cases, and clear contracts between systems.
- **Performance where it matters** – from low-level Zig/C/C++ components to efficient Python backends and streaming interfaces.
- **Reproducibility** – versioned infrastructure, experiment configurations, and data pipelines so results can be revisited and extended.
- **Long-term maintainability** – code and systems that can be handed over to in-house teams, not black boxes.

This combination of **research awareness** and **engineering discipline** allows the lab to take on projects that sit between a research prototype and a production system – exactly where many ambitious AI and HRI experiments live.

## Working with the lab

We typically collaborate with:

- research groups running complex online or lab experiments,
- innovation labs exploring new forms of human-AI interaction, and
- organisations that already have serious data and dashboards, but need an AI layer that **helps them decide and experiment**, not just chat.

If you're planning a project that needs **AI decision systems**, **experiment platforms**, or **custom lab infrastructure**, we're happy to explore whether it's a good fit for the lab.
